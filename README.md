# Spiderman Controller

In this game you can control a 
Spiderman-like carackter and swing through city skyline. 
The focus of the project was the swinging mechanism.

## Motivation

This was a assignment from a game development course where we had to research one or more game mechanics from another game and recreate them ourselves.
